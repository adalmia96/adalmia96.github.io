## Design Focus and Problem Space
I wanted to use this assignment focus on redesigning the Class Search page on SIS. As Class Search is one of the primary ways for students to find classes and make their schedule, I wanted to see what I can do to improve the experience
### Primary Users
Class Search is a page on SIS that is used by every student (both undergraduate and graduate) to help register classes. This page is used to find classes to either add them to your cart or register them directly. 
### Brief Overview of the Key Problems
_Note:This will be discussed in more detail in the Contextual Theory_
Currently SIS has a very Class Search tab that contains three different types of search: basic, advanced and multi-school. While these search options make it easy to distinguish based on logistic factors such as location and department, there tend to some problems I've noticed:
- Class Search options are very limited and contain very few filters that are actually useful to students.
- Also, once clicking "Search", there is little to no functionality supported to ordering your classes or to futher filter the options. 
- Finally, unlike most search engines, Class Search only works well if you know what your looking for. That means if you are a new student or a current student trying to find class about certain topics but don't know the class name or class id, then you are mostly out of lucky(more on this later). 
## Contextual Theory
To conduct this, I've asked one of my neighbors who is currently starting his college experience.
