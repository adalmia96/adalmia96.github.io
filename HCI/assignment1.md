## Design Focus and Problem Space
I wanted to use this assignment focus on redesigning the Class Search page on SIS. As Class Search is one of the primary ways for students to find classes and make their schedule, I wanted to see what I can do to improve the experience
### Primary Users
Class Search is a page on SIS that is used by every student (both undergraduate and graduate) to help register classes. This page is used to find classes to either add them to your cart or register them directly. 
### Brief Overview of the Key Problems
_Note:This will be discussed in more detail in the Contextual Theory_

Currently SIS has a very Class Search tab that contains three different types of search: basic, advanced and multi-school. While these search options make it easy to distinguish based on logistic factors such as location and department, there tend to some problems I've noticed:
- Class Search options are very limited and contain very few filters that are actually useful to students.
- Also, once clicking "Search", there is little to no functionality supported to ordering your classes or to futher filter the options. 
- Finally, unlike most search engines, Class Search only works well if you know what your looking for. That means if you are a new student or a current student trying to find class about certain topics but don't know the class name or class id, then you are mostly out of lucky(more on this later). 

## Contextual Theory
To conduct this, I've asked one of my neighbors(who I will refer as the subject for privacy) who is currently starting his college experience. This is perfect as he hasn't used SIS before and would be an example of a incoming student who doesn't have an exact idea of all the classes available and all the location of all the filters.
_Due to Privacy Reasons, I can not include a video of the Contextual Inquiry session_

### Task 1: Finding Only Writing Intensive Classes
The subject was asked to navigate to the the "Class Search" tab. As there are few classes in Spring 2021, the subject was asked to click on Fall 2021. The subject was then asked to search for writing intensive classes only. The first thing the subject did was write "Writing Intensive" in the "Class Title" and then searched. However as that produced nothing, he clicked back and then just clicked search without typing anything. I asked him why did he type nothing, and he said he thought that will show all classes. Then on the search page, he saw all classes and noticed the "Writing Intensive" column. He tried clicking on the column, however nothing happened and he then looked at the left side to see if there was an option. After a few minutes of clicking different places, he by accident clicked back and then said that "Basic search failed, let's try Advanced Search". Then he noticed immediately the "Writing Intensive Option" and clicked on that and searched.

_Key Takeaways_
- New users to Class Search do not immediately think to go to advanced search (in general the two additional search tabs were not used unless necessary)
- Something as important (and as we can seen as basic) as Writing Intensive was added to the advanced search and there was no clear way to change that 

### Task 2: Finding Classes on Certain Times and Days

### Task 3: Finding Classes in the Computer Science Department

### Task 4: Finding Classes Including Topics about the Civil War

### One Additional Discovery:
As we were looking at classes, one more thing the subject mentioned was when he was looking at the classes, he was annoyed that the classes were ordered by class number and could not be ordered by something like open seats. From his experience of class registration, he knew that as classes that have fewer seats are harder to get so he was indavertenly looking for larger class sizes so he make sure he can actually get the class.
